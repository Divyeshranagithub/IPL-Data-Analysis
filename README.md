# IPL Data Analysis

This repository contains scripts and notebooks for analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket data.

## Deployment
The project is deployed and can be accessed [here](https://ipl-data-analysis.streamlit.app/).


## Overview

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is one of the most popular Twenty20 cricket leagues worldwide. This project aims to analyze various aspects of IPL matches using data-driven approaches. The analysis includes but is not limited to player performance, team performance, match outcomes, and trends over different seasons.

## Data

The data used in this project is sourced from publicly available datasets related to IPL matches, players, and teams. These datasets include information such as match statistics, player details, team compositions, and more. The data is stored in CSV (Comma Separated Values) format, allowing easy manipulation and analysis using Python's pandas library.

## Analysis

The analysis is primarily conducted using Python programming language and its data science ecosystem, including libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. Jupyter notebooks are used extensively to document the analysis process and visualize the findings.

## Contents

- `data/`: Directory containing the raw data files in CSV format.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks documenting the analysis process and findings.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for use.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis or explore the IPL data, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using: `git clone https://github.com/Divyeshranagithub/IPL-Data-Analysis.git`
2. Navigate to the cloned repository: `cd IPL-Data-Analysis`
3. Install the required Python libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
